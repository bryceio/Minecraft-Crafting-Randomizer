# Minecraft Crafting Randomizer
 Randomizes Minecraft's crafting recipes.


# Use Instructions
 To use this program, which you can either do via the provided exe file or by compiling the code yourself, you need to first obtain the recipes that you want to randomize. These can be found in Minecraft's .jar file within .minecraft/versions/(version number). Once you've opened the jar file, go to the data/minecraft folder and copy the recipes folder out. 
 
 Before running the program, you will need to delete certain recipes from the folder as they are not compatible with the randomizer. These recipes will be listed at the end of this README document. Once you have removed the necessary recipes, put this folder and your .exe file in the same place and run the exe file.
 
 Once you follow the above steps, you will have a randomized recipes folder. To use this, you will need to make it into and install it as a datpack on your world. There are plenty of tutorials for doing this online, so I will not go into depth on that process. Use the provided pack.mcmeta file generated by the program when making your datapack.
 
If any issues arise while using this program, please let me know.
